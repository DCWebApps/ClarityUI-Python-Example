<h1>ClarityUI - Python Flask Example</h1>

This is a simple example of creating a Python Flask WebApp using Clarity UI 

There are a couple features in this page
* Simple login functionality using the Clarity login control 
* API connectivity to a rest API endpoint that lists out virtual machines 
* API Connectivity to a vRO endpoint that lists out all vRO workflows with their Item HREF 

Angular functionality is missing from the ClarityUI so it's purely the CSS/JS components. 

Enjoy!
